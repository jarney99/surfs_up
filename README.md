Above is the temperature data from December.

* We can see that in December the mean temperature is about 3 degrees cooler. 
* Although the max temperatures of the two months are similar, the min temperatures are quite different. The min temperature in December is 8 degrees cooler than in June. 
* The Data for the percentage is also cooler on average in December.
## Summary
After viewing the data for June and December, I believe that it would be a good business idea to start a surf and ice cream shop. The mean temperature is consistently above 70 degrees, so surfing would be popular year round. The only issue would be when December hit the cold days where the minimum temperature is 56 degrees. Although ice cream and surfing wouldn't be popular on those days, if the average is still above 70 degrees, it would still be popular.
